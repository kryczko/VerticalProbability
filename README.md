iVerticalProbability
===================

This is a program that takes and xyz file, and extracts the z-component data for oxygen atoms (labelled 'O' in the first column of the xyz file). 

When in a terminal, you run the file and input how many bins you would like. (ex: ./oxygen_atoms.py 100)

The output data is a z-component from 0 to 60 which has increments based on the number of bins and probabilities of finding an oxygen atom in each increment. The data file can be plotted easily once the program is run.
